<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>First Generation</li><li>Second Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors are classified into first and second generations based on their selectivity and potency. First-generation BTK inhibitors, like ibrutinib, are non-selective and may affect other kinases, potentially leading to side effects. Second-generation BTK inhibitors, such as acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are designed to be more selective for BTK, improving efficacy and reducing off-target effects. This differentiation allows for more tailored therapies in hematological malignancies, enhancing treatment outcomes and patient safety.</p></p>
