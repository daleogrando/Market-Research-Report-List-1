<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Ventilation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dilution Ventilation</li><li>Local Exhaust Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial ventilation systems can be categorized into two main types: dilution ventilation and local exhaust ventilation. Dilution ventilation involves introducing large volumes of clean air to dilute airborne contaminants, effectively lowering their concentration in a broader area. This method is typically used in spaces with lower contaminant levels. In contrast, local exhaust ventilation targets specific sources of pollutants by capturing and removing them at their origin, which is more efficient for high-contaminant areas, protecting worker health and safety.</p></p>
