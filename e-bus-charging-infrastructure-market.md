<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The E-bus Charging Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plug-in Charging Infrastructure</li><li>Overhead Charging Infrastructure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The E-bus charging infrastructure market is primarily divided into two types: plug-in charging infrastructure and overhead charging infrastructure. Plug-in charging infrastructure involves stationary charging stations where electric buses connect via plugs, making it suitable for depots and designated stops. Overhead charging infrastructure, on the other hand, utilizes overhead lines and pantographs to deliver power while the bus is in motion, promoting continuous operation without needing to stop for recharging. Both types play critical roles in supporting electric bus fleets and enhancing urban mobility.</p></p>
