<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aftermarket Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) consists of two main types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS utilizes sensors placed within the tire that directly measure the air pressure and temperature, providing real-time data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, doesn't use sensors in the tires; instead, it relies on the vehicle's anti-lock braking system (ABS) to monitor wheel speed variations, inferring pressure changes from these differences. Both systems enhance safety and fuel efficiency.</p></p>
